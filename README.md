# COVID-19-chatbot
As the spread of COVID-19 is increasing day by day the sense of panic and uncertainty among the people is also rising. Some people remain at home while some need to go out
to feed themselves as well as their family. The people who are going out are not sure what measures they should take to protect themselves in this pandemic. Moreover, many questions, rumors and misinformation are arising. As doctors are not able to 
to answer each and every question so there is a need of some tech which will be able to answer all the COVID-19 related questions to users directly. Hence a chatbot for COVID is implemented.
